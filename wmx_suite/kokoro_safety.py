"""Shared RULE #1 safety gating for the Kokoro benchmark workers.

Each Kokoro worker runs its whole sweep in a single process, so it needs:
  * a settled-baseline pre-flight that reserves headroom for the model load and is run
    BEFORE the heavy MLX/Metal import (so the import itself can't cross the wall first), and
  * a fresh per-step check that treats a read failure as UNSAFE (never trusting a stale
    startup snapshot).

This is the reactive Kokoro analogue of the predictive gate the LLM/embeddings paths use.
It is appropriate because Kokoro's footprint is small and nearly static, but unlike the
old per-worker checks it (a) reserves model-load headroom, (b) settles the baseline, and
(c) never falls back to a stale value on a failed read. For the concurrent batch worker it
also predicts the per-call transient × concurrency before running a rung.
