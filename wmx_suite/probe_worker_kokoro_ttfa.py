    "The MLX framework is an array framework for machine learning research on Apple Silicon, "
    "brought to you by Apple's machine learning research team. MLX is designed by machine learning "
    "researchers for machine learning researchers. The framework is intended to be user-friendly, "
    "yet still efficient to train and deploy models. The design of the framework itself is also "
    "conceptual-simple, and we want to make it easy for researchers to extend and explore. "
    "Kokoro is an open-weight TTS model with 82 million parameters. Despite its small size, it delivers "
    "exceptional quality, competing with much larger models. It is designed to run efficiently on local "
    "hardware. By running Kokoro on Apple Silicon via the MLX framework, we can achieve high-throughput "
    "audio synthesis with very low latency. This makes it ideal for real-time applications such as screen "
    "readers, interactive assistants, and voiceovers. Let us test the generation speed and efficiency. "
    "In order to perform a thorough benchmark, we must generate utterances of varying lengths. "
    "Utterance length is directly related to the computational complexity of the synthesis process. "
    "While causal language models have KV cache memory scaling issues, Kokoro uses a non-causal feedforward "
    "architecture; even so, its OS-wired memory footprint grows with utterance length, since longer output "
    "audio allocates larger buffers, and grows further under concurrent synthesis. "
    "Instead, the primary performance metric for text-to-speech is the Real-Time Factor, which measures "
    "how many seconds of audio can be generated per second of computation. A Real-Time Factor of less than "
    "one indicates that generation is faster than real-time. The smaller the Real-Time Factor, the faster "
    "the synthesis. Characters-per-second throughput is another key metric, indicating the raw processing speed. "
    "By measuring these factors across a range of text lengths, we can characterize the performance profile of "
    "the system and identify any non-linearities or overheads in the pipeline, such as tokenization, phonemization, "
    "and model dispatch latency. This benchmark provides crucial data for developers looking to integrate local "
    "TTS engines into their applications on macOS. We will evaluate performance under various conditions."
